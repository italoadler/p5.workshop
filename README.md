# 2D Game Remix: Runner and Beyond

## Overview

Welcome to the 2D Game Remix project! This project is a creative exploration based on an existing game, utilizing assets available on OpenGameArt. The primary goal is to experiment with different game mechanics and narratives using the same assets. The project follows a methodology created by the artist Italo Adler and starts with a runner mechanic, evolving into various new mechanics and storylines.

## Initial Mechanics

The initial version of the game features a runner mechanic where the horse moves automatically across the screen. The core features include:

- **Automatic Forward Movement**: The horse runs continuously without player control.
- **Jump Mechanic**: The horse can jump over obstacles using a key press.
- **Color Change**: The horse changes color as it collects magical flowers.
- **End Encounter**: The horse meets a sage at the end of the level, where it stops and bows.

## Experimental Mechanics and Features

As the project progresses, various experimental mechanics and features will be added. These include:

- **Parallax Background**: Enhance visual depth with multi-layered backgrounds moving at different speeds.
- **Double Jump**: Introduce a mechanic allowing the horse to perform a second jump while in mid-air.
- **Maze Level**: Create a complex maze with platforms and obstacles.
- **Timed Challenge Mode**: Add a mode where players must complete the level within a time limit.
- **Flower Boost**: Implement a temporary speed boost when collecting flowers.
